# The mock module

Python's mock module is hugely useful and flexible, but some of its
behavior is tricky. This directory includes my attempts to demystify
it a bit. Because of its trickiness I rarely find myself using it,
but I think I could benefit by using it a lot more. So this is the
beginning of trying to do that.
