# Immutability in Python

Motivation... why do we want immutable values or variables?

You cannot do it perfectly but you can do some things. There are a number of
"frozen" data structures available in Python3 that are resistant to
modifications of their internal. Again, not perfect, these mods can be made if
you work a bit, but it requires a conscious effort.
