# Literate programming hacks for Python

I have a bunch of things to go here.

* Figure out how to do straight-up literate programming without
  losing the benefit of a nice IDE like PyCharm. Stick the texty
  stuff in a Python source file, probably as a docstring? Or put
  it in a separate file?
* What about semantic web stuff? Maybe adapt JSON-LD or RDFa to
  work with Markdown?
* Markdown in docstrings could be very cool, alas PyCharm doesn't
  know how to deal with that.

Look at pydoc. Can pydoc do Markdown?
