# Fun Python hacks

These days I work a lot in Python, which I consider a blessing.
This repository is a collection of a bunch of assorted Python hacks
I've done myself, or seen, over recent months/years. Maybe some day
I'll get ambitious and put in some kind of index or table of contents
or something, but for now it's just a bunch of directories.
